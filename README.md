# Flower Disease Detection System

Overview
This project focuses on detecting diseases in flowers using image classification techniques. The goal is to assist in the early identification of plant diseases, enabling timely intervention and improved plant health management.

The project was developed as an academic machine learning application and demonstrates the use of computer vision for real-world agricultural and biological use cases.

Problem Statement
Plant diseases can significantly impact crop quality and yield if not detected early. Manual inspection is time-consuming and requires expertise. This project aims to automate flower disease detection using machine learning by analyzing images of flowers.

Approach
- Used image-based machine learning techniques to classify flowers as **healthy or diseased**
- Performed image preprocessing to prepare data for model training
- Trained and evaluated a classification model using Python
- Built an interactive interface to allow users to upload flower images and receive predictions

Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** Image Classification  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow  
- **Interface:** Gradio  
- **Dataset Source:** Publicly available flower disease image datasets (e.g., Kaggle)

Key Features
- Image upload-based disease prediction
- Real-time inference through a user-friendly interface
- Simple and interpretable output for end users

Results & Learnings
- Achieved reliable classification performance on test images
- Gained hands-on experience in image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Learned how to integrate machine learning models with interactive interfaces using Gradio

Limitations
- Performance depends on image quality and lighting conditions
- Model trained on a limited dataset; results may vary for unseen flower species

Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include more flower species and disease types
- Improve model accuracy with data augmentation
- Deploy the application as a hosted web service for wider accessibility
